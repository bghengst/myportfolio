            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>I am originally from San Francisco. Wanting to gain more experience I decided to move away from home and attended Syraucse University
              While at Syraucse I received a Bachelor of Science in Economics as well as a B.A. in International Relations. They both taught me valuable skills.
              With Economics I learned that everything has a cost whether in absolute terms or oppurtunity cost and the importance og logical thinking. International Relations taught 
                  taught me the importance to always look at challenges or projects outside my own perspective.  
              
              After Syracuse I moved to New York City where I currently reside. Being in  locked down in quarentine I decided to learn a new skill as well as to break up the monotony of my days.
              So far, I have really enjoyed coding and I am glad that I took up the oppurtunity to learn something new.

              <br>
              <br>

            <p>I first became interested in coding after reading the book "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Niel, a data science professor at Columbia University.
              She illustrates in her book how data and algorithems are often used in the wrong way. Such as having too small a sample size or not being transparent on how the code is written.
              These algorithems have a huge impact on peoples lives, such as evaluating teacher performance to job applicants. Everywhere in our lives there is an oppurtunity for unknown algorithems being used
              unethically. 
            </p>
            <p>This originally peaked my interest. As someone who had only heard about coding I decided to learn more and thus I enrolled through a Columbia University full stack development bootcamp.
              Data is becoming the new oil. But how we use that new technology efficiently and ethically will be a part of the discussion. That is a discussion I would like to have a seat at.
            </p>
